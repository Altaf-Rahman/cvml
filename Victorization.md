**Vectorization**
Vectorization is a trick used for faster and efficient calculation of arrays. Vectorization actually 
performs multiple operations at one time i.e in parallel. Let formally define vectorization and then we 
will dive in to Assignment 1 of Cs231n , where L2 distance (Eucladian) is assigned to implement both with loops 
and vectorization.

Suppose we have two vectors **A** and **B** of size *n* * *1* and *n* * *1*. And want to add them
