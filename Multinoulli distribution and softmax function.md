#Multinoulli distribution

I was actually learning softmax loss function and was confused by that softmax function has a multinoulli distribution. 
That was alot of confusion for me and the mathematics going with it. But finally I defined it in simple terms which I am 
going to present here
 
 As working in machine learning let we have to classify three examples of [cat, car , frog], Let we have n number of training examples for classfying these three examples with our machine learning algorithm. So here at output we will have a probabilistic score through softmax function. 
 
 Now If we train one image we will have one output probabilistic score of one denoted as x_1 of size k*1, then with other example we will have another vector of x_2 ( if now we have another probability scores), and similarly we will have n number of scores
